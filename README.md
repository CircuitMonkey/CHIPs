# CHIPs (aka CHIPz)

CHIPz modules are sub-circuits cooked down into a SMT module with a Cyberpunk Tech aesthetic.

The edge contacts are castelated and resemble the edge of a postage stamp.  Like similar modules on the market, CHIPs are designed to be soldered to a larger PCB board.  One advantage of the CHIPz modules is that a design can be revised or re-engineered to improve a larger design without having to redesign the whole system.  CHIPz also makes it convenient to pre-build smaller modules with common or repetive functions and use them over and over in other larger designs.

Almost all of the numbered designs were designed in EagleCAD and were intended to be sold into the hobby electronics market.  Alas, I have given up on that dream, but offer these designs for anyone who wishes to use them or just study the things I have made over the years. My current and future designs are now made with KiCAD.

I still design CHIPz modules and other things, but not for the purpose of manufacturing or selling.  I use the modules in my own creations and wish to share those things for anyone who has a similar need or wishes to simply understand the workings of these things.

If you wish to simply make a module, you can generally upload the Eagle BRD or KiCAD_PCB file directly to [OSH Park PCB](https://OSHPark.com) for preview and fabrication.

Everyting here is open source with minimal (if at all) license requirements.  Copy, mash-up and use to your hearts content.

## NOTE
New designs will be placed in a sub-directory, like [Synth] is.  Older designs will be moved eventually into a sub-folder but for now will dominate the file listing you see.


Enjoy,
